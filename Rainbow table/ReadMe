 Construct a list of scores and allow the user to interact with the list. You must use a
linked chain that you have created yourself. You must create instances of the node class, and connect them
together appropriately. Do not use any of the prebuilt classes available in the JDK that create lists already (e.g.,
Linked List, Array List).
